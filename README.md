## *Description*
This is a pet project created with the Unity engine, specifically designed for Android devices. The game is a basic memory card game with several additional modes.

### Infinity, Basic, and Mistake:
Infinity mode allow to play endless round with same card pack. every turn possible scores for a pair are increses.
Basic mode is a classic memory game with rounds and average scoring.
Mistake mode introduces a mistake limitâ€”you can make only 3 incorrect card selections. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible by remembering more cards without exceeding mistakes.

### Swipe adding mode
You can enhance any game mode with the swipe feature. Each time you make a mistake, a random pair of cards will swap positions, adding an extra layer of challenge and requiring greater attention. Joker can spaw its position too.

### Joker card mode
If an odd number of cards is selected, the Joker mode can be enabled. In this mode, a Joker card is added without a matching pair. The Joker remains on the board until the end of the round
